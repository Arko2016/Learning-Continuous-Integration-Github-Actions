### Objective
**Learning-Continuous-Integration-Github-Actions**
Understand basic concepts related to CI (continuous integration) as well as implement the same using Github Actions

### What is Continuous Integration(CI)?
- CI automates the integration of code changes into a shared repository, ensuring that the codebase remains consistent and reliable
- CI in MLOps involves not just code but also model components, data, and pipelines, and it focuses on automated testing and validation of these elements

### Need for CI
1. Early Issue Detection: CI automates testing and validation of code changes, including unit tests, integration tests, and performance tests, as well as data validation. This helps identify and resolve issues like bugs, integration problems, and performance degradation early in the development cycle, preventing them from escalating into larger problems later on. 
2. Maintaining Model Stability: By continuously integrating and testing code and model components, CI helps ensure that the ML model remains stable and reliable over time. This is crucial for preventing regressions or unexpected behavior when new features or updates are introduced. 
3. Enabling Faster Iterations: CI automates the process of building, testing, and packaging code and models, allowing data scientists to experiment with new ideas and updates more rapidly. This automation accelerates the development cycle and encourages more frequent experimentation, leading to faster innovation. 
4. Promoting Collaboration and Reproducibility: CI promotes collaboration by allowing multiple developers to contribute to the same project and ensures that all changes are tracked and can be easily rolled back if needed. It also facilitates the reproducibility of results by providing a standardized process for building, testing, and deploying models. 
5. Streamlining Deployment: CI can be integrated with continuous deployment (CD) pipelines, enabling automated deployment of tested and validated models to production environments. This automation reduces the manual effort required for deployment and speeds up the process of getting models into production.
